# Happy Thoughts
 
Happy Thoughts is like a simple Twitter, and uses fetch from an API to get the information and likes. And also useEffect.
 
## The problem
 
At first I was thinking too big with the components, but after taking a step back and rethinking my project, and I ended up with three components. I solved it though using the knowledge i have from previous weeks, to easier understand the project and problems. If i had more time i'd make the like button gray if you have not liked the post and loading.
