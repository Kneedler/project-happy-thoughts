My reflections on how this week's project turned out: 
I still have a hard time grasping it all, but i think i got an basic understanding on what the useEffect and useState does, all tho i have a hard time explaining it just yet i have an understanding in my head so far. I think it turned out as I wanted it too and I'm happy that it works.
 
Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail: 
Probably, but I don't know what right now.
